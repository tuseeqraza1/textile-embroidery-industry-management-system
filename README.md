# Textile Embroidery Industry Management System

It was my semester project; I worked on object-oriented programming using JAVA. Also, I have made a custom GUI for this project.

This project was created by consulting with a Textile Embroidery Industry to develop a system that aims to reduce the headache of manually managing and calculating each and everything of the industry. And hence improve the efficiency and speed up overall processing.
